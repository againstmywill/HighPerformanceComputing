IMPLEMENTATION OF K NEAREST NEIGHBORS IN JAVA

K Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric, instanced-based learning algorithm
Non-parametric meaning that instead of using a probability distribution derived from the data. It is compared directly against the training data
Instance-based learning, lazy learning, instead of creating an abstraction from the training data, it instead stores all the training data and compares the query to the data and classifies it according to its nearest neighbors

WHAT IS K NEAREST NEIGHBORS

K Nearest Neighbors is a simple algorithm where the test data is compared to all training data points by using one of the methods to find distance between it and the rest of the data, takes the K nearest data points and then classifies the test data according to whatever the majority that its nearest neighbors are.
